## Algorithms & Technical Approaches

Those will surely be very good

## Requirements & Focus Points

1. Efficiency, clear comments, clear file structure, proper error handling
1. Make the heuristics exciting
1. Allow difficulty levels (probably just depth of search)
1. GUI somehow
1. Player vs Computer, that's it (with the option to choose who starts I imagine)
